- ./caustic
 - Folder containing a worked-out example that demonstrates how one can model fold caustics by expanding the fermat potential to third order. It implements the potential in herculens, plots the critical curves and image positions, demonstrates how one can model the potential in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the potential expanded to second order, how inserting an NFW lens breaks the caustic relationships, and how one can perform PE on the NFW lens.
